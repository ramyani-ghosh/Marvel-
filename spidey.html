							<p>Real Name: Peter Benjamin Parker<br><br>
Height: 5'10"<br><br>
Weight: 167 lbs.<br><br>
Powers: Peter can cling to most surfaces, has superhuman strength (able to lift 10 tons optimally) and is roughly 15 times more agile than a regular human. The combination of his acrobatic leaps and web-slinging enables him to travel rapidly from place to place. His spider-sense provides an early warning detection system linked with his superhuman kinesthetics, enabling him the ability to evade most any injury, provided he doesn't cognitively override the autonomic reflexes. Note: his power enhancements through his transformation by the Queen and after battling Morlun - including his organic web glands and stingers - have been undone after Spider-Man's deal with Mephisto.<br><br>
Abilities: Peter is an accomplished scientist, inventor and photographer. <br><br> </p>
